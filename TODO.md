# TO-DO

improve the art contest theme voting (maybe wait for the discord poll thing)

add timestamp to the art contest submissions?

link to discord message in the google form? (only needed if only being able to use pngs becomes a issue)

art contest check if it was naturly started or not and if end the event

better sync command still?

# random things to look into:

beter profile pic for bot



# probably not but MAYBE
POLL COMMAND v2: switch to buttons? or maybe just remove the commmand since discord is adding there own poll thing it seems

REACTION ROLES v2: switch to buttons?
